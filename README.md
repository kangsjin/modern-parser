# modern-parser

This project is a studyüìñ initiative aimed at understanding how interpreters work. It was inspired by a [tutorial series on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_2VhOvlMk4XDeq2eOOSDQMrbZj9zIU_b&si=AFQH9J1PFuSnqlJC) that explains the process using the Go language.

_‚ö†Ô∏è However, instead of using Go, I have chosen to implement the code in TypeScript and Bun._
